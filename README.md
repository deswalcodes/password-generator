# Password Generator

A simple password generator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

✅ Generate random passwords of custom length  
✅ User can choose to include:
- Alphabets (A–Z, a–z)
- Numbers (0–9)
- Special characters (`!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?`)

✅ Copy the generated password to clipboard with one click  
✅ Responsive and clean user interface

## How to use

1. Enter the desired password length  
2. Select the character types (alphabets, numbers, special characters) using checkboxes  
3. Click **Generate Password**  
4. Copy the generated password if needed

If no options are selected, the generator will default to alphabets only.

## Assumptions

- “Alphabets” means both uppercase and lowercase letters  
- If no checkboxes are checked, fallback is to use alphabets  
- Minimum password length is 1  
- Generation happens fully on the client side (no data is stored)
